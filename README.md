# WPF-MVVM-Lab

**Hands-on experiments and studies with WPF, MVVM, and XAML, including Python integration.**

---

## Overview

This repository contains sample projects, code snippets, and experiments exploring:

- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)** for building desktop UIs  
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** design pattern  
- **XAML** for UI layout and styling  
- **Python / IronPython** integration with WPF for dynamic UI

The goal is to provide a learning playground for developers who want to understand WPF, MVVM patterns, and how to use Python to manipulate XAML UIs.
